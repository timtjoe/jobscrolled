### About JobScrolled
Finding remote work can be a nightmare, especially for developers outside of Europe or North America. Many platforms filter out "worldwide" listings because their primary user base isn't looking for them. **JobScrolled** was built to bridge this gap, prioritizing high-quality, worldwide remote frontend roles that offer the same perks and credibility as regional listings.

Beyond a polished interface, JobScrolled is a "worldwide-first" platform. It empowers everyone—regardless of location—to tap into the vast global repository of remote and digital nomad opportunities.

### About the Developer
I am a Full-Stack Developer dedicated to crafting modern UIs that feel fast, clean, and intuitive. With **5+ years of experience**, I thrive on the joy that a well-built interface brings to users. 

Interestingly, my journey into code started with a fascination for Operating Systems. While I love the frontend, I still enjoy delving into low-level programming and OS concepts. I’m always looking for opportunities that allow me to be creative, solve complex problems, and contribute to products that reach a global audience.
